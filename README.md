## Challenges

Working with a lot of infomation is always a hand full. Giving the fact that we where giving not as much time to do the work,
the ratio how much i needed to study and understand concept I am not familier with in order to finsh the project was not balanced. 
This gave me problems during my project. I found myself doing more research rather than hard coding. This slowed my pace and was an inconvince.

In the program I was not able to complete the user side of the web project, but I was able to complete the host side of it. In the host side, you can edit movie lsitings
, add, delete, review and save to the data base. You can also manage the flow of the website.

## Feedback

During the cousre of the project I made use of ASP.net C#, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, MS SQL Server Database & Visual 
Studio to complete my project. It was a challenging effort to use all these languages and create something good.
It was very hard to bring together information I had to sort out which was not previuosly tought to us, but I tried to make the best i could with the time i had.
